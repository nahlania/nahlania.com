                <h2>UX Design & Development</h2>
            </div>
            <p>UX Development and Design is a somewhat new concept for me. In 2020, when I was working on a project to design and develop a Workflow Management Platform by <span class="bold-bodyText">VBA</span>, I got familiar with the UX conception. I tried to learn more about it and utilized its most important measures in my in-progress project, resulting in a fully customized workflow administration system. I got increasingly interested in UX Design and decided to pursue my education in this field to integrate my skill and passion in digital arts and coding. Taking Post-Baccalaureate Diploma program in <span class="bold-bodyText">Web and Mobile Design and Development</span> at Langara College in Vancouver was a life-changing decision. Here at Langara, I hone my skills in <span class="bold-bodyText">Adobe Illustrator, Figma, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span>, and collaborate with teammates in <span class="bold-bodyText">Human-Centered Design</span> Projects.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I have worked as a passionate commercial artist focused on advertising photography. Since I prefer to have control over the final touch of my captured images, editing and retouching images is an integral part of my photography job. I utilize the most recent <span class="bold-bodyText">lighting technics</span> as well as editing software such as <span class="bold-bodyText">Adobe Lightroom</span> and <span class="bold-bodyText">Adobe Photoshop</span> to create quality images.</p>
            <p>Over the past years, I collaborated with a health magazine and an advertising magazine publishing in Iran as a freelance photographer to create marketing content. Additioanally, I performed tens of photography projects for musicians, fashion designers and local resturants.</p>

                <p>Travelling and adventure are inseparable parts of my life. I'm really into camping and mountaineering. I believe in this quote from Paulo Coelho that says:</p>
