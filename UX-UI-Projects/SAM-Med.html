                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>SAM Medical is a newly founded company in Vancouver. The managers of the business wanted a website to showcase their products and services. Initially, they didn't plan to have an online store. However, I suggested and created a scalable WooCommerce website that could serve both their short-term and long-term business goals. This structure is an ideal solution to exhibit their products and provide detailed descriptions of their specifications, delivering a great experience for website visitors.</p>

                <h3>Understanding the Growing Need for Mobility Aids</h3>
                <div class="">
                    <p>Canada has <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/as-sa/98-200-X/2021004/98-200-X2021004-eng.cfm" class="inline-link" target="_blank" title="Statistics Canada">one of the fastest-growing senior populations</a> among developed countries. The number of people aged 85 and older is expected to triple by 2046, intensifying the need for accessible healthcare and support services.</p>
                    <p>As of 2022, 7.6 million Canadians (18.9%
                        ) were aged 65 or older. Many experience age-related mobility challenges. The Canadian Survey on Disability in 2022 reported that over 8 million Canadians aged 15+ have at least one disability, with mobility impairments among the most common.</p>
                    <p>This growing demand fuels the steady rise in need for mobility aids, such as rollators and canes that enable seniors to maintain independence in daily life.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="">
                <h3>Barriers to Accessing Mobility Supports</h3>
                <p>Despite the need, accessing mobility aids remains a challenge for many:</p>
                <ul class="list-style">
                    <li><span class="bold-text">Digital Literacy Gap:</span> In 2022, 46% of people with disabilities reported difficulty using digital services. Many seniors struggle with navigating online platforms independently.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-text">Limited In-Store Options:</span> Local pharmacies and medical stores often carry only a limited selection of mobility aids, pushing users to look online for more choices.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-text">Confusing Online Experiences:</span> Many websites are not senior-friendly. 17% of Canadians with disabilities report issues using the internet for services due to poor accessibility and unclear language.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-text">Affordability and Coverage:</span> While some provinces offer financial support for mobility aids, awareness and eligibility vary widely, leaving many without the help they need.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Understanding the Goals</h2>
            <div class="two-column two-space-after">
                <p>The first step was looking through SAM Medical’s lens to uncover their immediate goals and broader potential. In early stakeholder interviews, it became clear that the team primarily wanted a basic, brochure-style website, something minimal to establish an online presence. Their focus was on credibility and legitimacy, rather than functionality or future growth.</p>
                <p>However, during our conversations, I noticed a disconnect between their current ask and their ambitious mission: to deliver innovative medical solutions across Canada and improve access for underserved patients. While the stakeholders hadn’t initially considered e-commerce or user-centered features, my research into industry trends, competitor offerings, and user needs (especially among seniors and caregivers) revealed that a scalable, user-friendly platform could offer real long-term value.</p>
                <p>I took the initiative to guide the team toward a more forward-thinking solution, one that would not only showcase their credibility but also support future growth and reach. As a result, I proposed building the site on WordPress with WooCommerce capabilities. This allowed us to launch a simple yet scalable website that could later support full e-commerce functionality with minimal friction.</p>
                <p>The final design strikes a balance: it fulfills their current need for a professional online presence, while laying the groundwork for product discoverability, accessibility, and future online sales.</p>
            </div> 
            <div>
                <p>Here I highlight the shift from stakeholders' original expectations for a simple website toward a more strategic, scalable UX solution based on research insights and user needs.</p>
                <ul class="list-style">
                    <li>Basic brochure website to establish credibility <span class="inline-space"><i class="fa-solid fa-right-long colored"></i></span> Scalable e-commerce-ready site to support future growth</li>

                        <p>Given the primary user group includes seniors and people with disabilities, accessibility and mobile usability were top priorities. These features ensure that the website is inclusive, easy to navigate, and usable across devices regardless of physical or digital literacy limitations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                        <p>To support users I implemented a navigation experience that balances simplicity with guidance:</p> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span class="bold-text">“Contact Us for Consultation” CTA</span> that is strategically placed on home page and product pages,directing users to a simplified contact page where they can ask for help choosing a product.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="bold-text">Search bar</span> available on every page, positioned in the footer, anticipating user behavior, especially seniors who naturally scroll down to look for help or next steps. it improves findability for users who prefer direct search rather than browsing through categories.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="bold-text">Clear and logical product categorization</span> makes it easy for users to explore even if they don’t know the exact product name

                        <p>To make complex medical products approachable and easier to understand, I designed a progressive, modular product page layout. This approach breaks down information into smaller, digestible sections, respecting the cognitive load of senior users and aligning with accessibility best practices. Here's how the structure works:</p>

            <h2>Site Map</h2>
            <div class="two-column space-after">
                <p class="">To ensure users—especially seniors and caregivers—can easily navigate the website, I created a clear and scalable site structure. This site map outlines the content hierarchy, allowing visitors to intuitively move from general categories to specific products, accessories, and support options. The design emphasizes on:</p>
                <ul class="list-style">
                    <li>Clear categorization of products for easier discovery.</li>
                    <li>Consistent structure on all product pages</li>
                    <li>A dedicated Contact Us pathway available across key sections.</li>
                    <li>Search functionality to help users find what they need at any stage.</li>
                    <li>A homepage that introduces the company and brands, highlights product categories, and invites users to reach out.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This structure supports both current business needs and future expansion, such as enabling e-commerce capabilities, while maintaining an accessible and senior-friendly layout.</p>

            <div>
                <p>After validating the site map with stakeholders, I moved directly into developing a custom WordPress theme to save time and streamline the process. This approach allowed me to work efficiently while staying aligned with the brand identity and structural modules defined in the site map. To ensure a seamless and consistent user experience across all devices, I designed both the mobile and desktop views in parallel.</p>

                <h3>Home Page</h3>

It features a clean layout with clear product categories, a brief introduction to the company, and a prominent “Contact Us for Consultation” button to guide users toward support. The design balances informative content with minimal distractions, making it easy for seniors and caregivers to navigate from the very first interaction.</p>
