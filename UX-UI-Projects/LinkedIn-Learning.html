                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>LinkedIn Learning provides access to personalized course recommendations based on data-driven insights. Although the content recommendations on Learning are based on LinkedIn profile, groups, and connections, it's an independent application from LinkedIn. In this study, I reviewed the entire user flow on the mobile application and compared it with the web app to check consistency in UX. For redesign purposes, I only focused on My Learning flow and all its descendants.</p>

            <div class="two-column">
                <p>For this study, my objective was to enhance the user experience of the LinkedIn Learning mobile application. I began by examining how easy it is for learners who use both the mobile and web apps to switch between them seamlessly. Another aim was to improve the overall experience for learners who frequently use the LinkedIn Learning mobile app, taking into account device limitations.</p> 
                <p>To answer this question, researching the solution space was necessary to know the real users' goals and pain points. However, since LinkedIn Learning has some bold competitors with a potential common user base, researching problem space could bring many valuable insights, as well.</p>
                <p>For conducting research, surveys seemed to be an effective method as it allows access to a larger user population. The next step would be conducting interviews with learners who use LinkedIn Learning and other platforms. By asking attitudinal questions, I could learn about the frictions faced while switching between the website and application, and how their experience compares with LinkedIn Learning and other platforms. Another research method could be mapping the journey of real users to identify necessary modifications and potential new features. However, due to time and budget constraints, I conducted a limited survey and created a service design blueprint based on two user interviews.</p>

                <p>After conducting a thorough examination of the application on both mobile and web platforms, I have identified some key areas that require improvement. In particular, the section entitled "My Learning" was the focus of my analysis regarding the application's redesign.</p>
                <p>In the original design, some features such as "Audio only" are targeted towards mobile users, taking into account their device and network limitations. However, there are still some features that are only available on the website, which could pose a problem for users who rely on the app to learn while on the go. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all necessary features are accessible on both platforms.</p>
                <p>Upon analyzing My Learning/My Library, I noticed a lengthy list of collections. It seems that the content and order of these collections are subject to change regularly. While this dynamic listing is necessary for sourcing relevant content, the constant changes in ordering and displaying them in an long list can be confusing to users.</p>
                <p>Another issue I discovered is that each action on the application involves multiple, unnecessary navigations. This can lead to confusion and frustration for users. To address this, combining pages and functions in some cases could result in a more efficient and user-friendly interface.</p>
                <p>Additionally, integrating settings and preferences from LinkedIn profiles into the learning app can make it confusing for users. In some instances, an action takes the user to the LinkedIn application without giving notice and providing a way to return to the Learning app. Therefore, it's important to treat LinkedIn Learning as an independent application.</p>

                <h3>My Learning/My Library</h3>
                <p>My Learning/My Library is the main page that users regularly use to continue their learning process or to start a new course from saved options. In the heuristic evaluation, I noticed the following:</p>
                <ul class="list-style">
                    <li>There are five categories in this page and to explore the full list of each, the user needs to navigate to another page</li>
                    <li>The page is long and the final categories can be easily missed</li>
                    <li>A better placement for “My Goals” can be profile section, where the skills are also displayed</li>
                    <li>Cards are inconsistent in different categories of “My Library”</li>
                    <li>The functions which are available for content in the cards are different. For instance, in downloaded courses, the only available function is removing downloaded file</li>
                    <li>The learning progress can be more clear in any specific course</li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                <h3>Course Full View</h3>
                <p>The Course Full View is where users interact with course and all its available options. During the heuristic evaluation, I observed that there is significant inconsistency between the web app and mobile app in this flow. To better understand these differences, I compared side-by-side screenshots of the mobile and desktop versions.</p>
