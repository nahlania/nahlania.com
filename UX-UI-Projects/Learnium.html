            <p>In today’s fast-paced world, the demand for efficient and effective learning solutions is higher than ever before. However, “Passive learning” is still the dominant way of learning new topics for most people, whether it’s by reading a book, watching a video, or listening to a podcast. The problem is that it doesn’t result in the best understanding of the topic and the learner cannot memorize key information.
            Better results can be achieved through “Interactive learning” where learners have opportunities to practice the knowledge with quizzes or flashcards, see their progress and areas of improvement, and customize and research for further content. But this approach is a real hard work. 
            </p>
            <p>In an extensive research involving 300 million students around the world, Professor John Hattie of the University of Melbourne has <a href="https://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/" class="inline-link" target="_blank">evaluated 252 variables</a> and their effect sizes related to student achievement. Hattie was curious about which variables would have the biggest impact. ”Although almost everything we do improves learning, why not prioritize the ones that will have the greatest effect?” Hattie calculated a score or effect size for each according to its impact on the students’ learning and took into account any aspects that could be taken into account as regards implementation costs. In this list, around half of the variables have Potential to accelerate or considerably accelerate student achievement. We have been focusing on some of these variables in our project, which we combined with user interviews result to come up with the application’s features.</p>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <div class="interview">
            <h3>User Interview</h3>
            <p>To gather qualitative data about the users, we conducted a user interview process. Our main objective was to identify our user persona, their pain points, goals, and stories. We began with a pre-assumption of the user’s demography and categorized the users into three main learner types: high-school students, college or university students, and professionals who are studying for a career shift or promotions. We designed the interview questions to gain a deep understanding of our users’ needs, frustrations, and goals in the following areas:</p>
            <ul class="list-style">
                <li>What are their frustrations when studying topics that require reading and memorizing?</li>
                <li>What method of studying works best for them?</li>
                <li>How do they keep engaged in learning a specific topic without getting bored and quitting?</li>
                <li>How do they ensure that they are competent after studying a topic?</li>
                <li>How do they prepare for an upcoming exam?</li>
                <li>What assistive methods do they use to learn more efficiently?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Interpret & Analysis</h3>
            <p>We conducted and recorded nine user interviews and analyzed the answers using the thematic method in which we reviewed the answers, summarized key points, categorized and clustered them to define themes. This helped us to identify the key pain points and goals of our users and led to defining user persona and main features that meet the needs of our users and address their pain points.</p>

            <p>In another research, we designed a survey and gathered answers from 40 college and university students. The purpose of this survey was to modify the quiz feature where we asked the questions in the following areas:</p>
            <ul class="list-style">
                <li>Frequency of taking quizzes or practice questions when preparing for exams</li>
                <li>The optimal number of questions in the learning apps</li>
                <li>Relationship between the difficulty of the exam material and the number of questions in a quiz</li>
                <li>Types of regular academic tests(MCQ, Written, True/False, Other)</li>
                <li>Relationship between taking quizzes/practice sessions and competency</li>

        <div class="two-column">
            <p>While there are existing e-Learning platforms and tools, “Learnium” differentiates itself through its unique combination of features:</p>
            <h4>AI-Powered Content Generation</h4>
            <p>Few competitors offer AI-generated quizzes, flashcards, and summaries from user-uploaded content.</p>
            <h4>Structured Learning Material</h4>
            <p>Learnium identifies key topics in an imported material and based on that creates learning sessions for the user. This feature brings a school-like structure to the learning experience and simplifies acquiring process and is unique to Learnium.</p>

This feature is unique to Learnium as well.</p>
            <h4>AI Assistant</h4>
            <p>AI Assistant is a chat bot which searches for the answers only through the imported material to ensure reliability. Whenever the learner has questions or needs clarification on the coursework, the AI Assistant provides detailed and insightful answers, often accompanied by clarifying examples, allowing user to grasp complex concepts with ease. Among the existing applications, only Learnium offers this feature</p>
            <h4>Focus Mode</h4>
            <p>It temporarily silences notifications, adjusts screen settings for optimal readability, and provides a distraction-free environment for deep learning. Only Learnium offers this feature to maximize the learning efficiency.</p>
            <h4>Progress Tracker</h4>
            <p>Learnium uses the results of the quizzes to show which areas user did well and which areas need improvement. It also keeps a track of the learning progress in specific courses and key topics. Other existing applications also provide this feature in different forms.</p>
            <h4>Motivation Factor</h4>
            <p>We designed Learnium to be an engaging and motivational application. Learnium’s mascot, Dr.Lumi, appears on different screens with relevant and motivational messages to encourage learners to strive for better results. Daily challenge is another feature that is designed to keep learners engaged in learning, even when they’re not actively studying. All other competitor have a method to keep the users engaged.</p>

        <div class="max-width">
            <h2>Main Features</h2>
            <p>To define the main features and their functionalities, we organized and analyzed the gathered data from user interviews, surveys, and competitor research. Then, based on the user persona and their needs and frustrations, we defined the main features in design meetings.</p>
            <div class="grid">

            </div>     
            <p>Then, through the meetings among members of the design and development teams, we communicated the UX design decisions to the developers to form a shared understanding of the user perspective and product features. It led to modifying the features that not only are required for an optimum user experience but also are feasible considering technical and time limitations.</p>

                    <h3 class="colored">Interactive Content</h3>
                    <p>Creating interactive content in Learnium is possible through uploading PDF, pasting text from other sources, taking photo of the book pages and using OCR technology to turn photo into text. Leveraging Generative AI,Learnium scans through imported material and generates the key topics that user needs to practice in each learning session. Key topics include three specific modules; quiz, flashcards and summary. These tools align with the content, ensuring accuracy and relevance, and integrate to create a “Structured Learning Material”.</p>

                    <p>Learnium tailors study sessions to user’s learning preferences and upcoming exam dates. The study plan is responsive to the learner’s progress and quiz results and covers everything that the learner needs to practice to achieve a certain result. While Fixed schedules don’t adapt to individual needs. This feature solves this problem by dynamically adjusting schedules based on content, exam date, and quiz performance, reducing overwhelm or boredom.</p>

        <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <p class="two-column">The user flow consists of four flows. The first flow allows user to import material and set a due date for that material. In this flow, we also considered proffessionals and casual users who don't want to use the study planner. The second flow, study, is dedicated to the methods that learners can interact with the leraning content. It also provides a dynamic study planner which is responsive to the changes in due dates and content volume. The progress flow shows the learning progress, both topic-based and time-based. And the last flow is daily challeng which helps users recall the past learning materials.</p>

            <h3>Study Flow (Home Screen)</h3>
            <p>This is the first page that the user views, after logging into the application. For a learner who's been using the app for a while and imported content, the learning schedule is shown as Today's Plan. It consists of three sections:</p>
            <ul class="list-style">
                <li>New content that is planned to be learned today</li>
                <li>Missed content from previous days which is content that the user hasn't started yet</li>
                <li>Review includes content that the user hasn't got an average of 80% or more in the taken quizzes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the first iteration, we wanted the user to be able to see all the content categories at a glance. That's the reason we incorporated Next Days’ Plan, Recent Materials, All Folders, and Create New Learning Material on the same page as Today's Plan, as followed:</p>
            <div class="wireframe-images">

            </div>
            <p>In the user testing, we noticed that this design confused the users and they couldn't find the main intended actions on the page. Therefore, in the second iteration, we removed all unnecessary sections from the home page to help the user focus on the most important action on the page which is starting the Study.</p>

Don't take criticism personally, see it as advice for your work, not you as a person. Being open to feedback helps your work improve, while is an opportunity for personal growth.</span></li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Iterative design: </span><br><span>
                There's no perfect solution for a design challenge because users may have different mental models. Each solution has its advocates and critics. However, the key lies in the process of iterations and testing. We faced this challenge in the design of the flashcards, when different users had differnt expectaions while testing the app. The final design is a result of this ongoing process, shaped by feedback and user testing, ensuring that it not only meets the needs of the audience but also stands up to the diverse perspectives it might encounter.</span></li>

Later we needed to narrow down the project scope and this feature was pushed to the extension plan. However, I believe to make an accessible app for a wider range of learners such as people with dyslexia, this feature should be implemented.</span></li>
                    <li><span class="bold-text">Study group: </span><br><span>Following the user interviews, we found a common pattern among some of the interviewees who prefer to study in groups and the competition among the group motivates them to push themselves. However, since adding this study group feature would widen the project scope dramatically, we pushed it to the extension plan.</span></li>
