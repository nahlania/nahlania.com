        <div class="two-column">
            <p>In today’s fast-paced world, the demand for efficient and effective learning solutions is higher than ever before. However, “Passive learning” is still the dominant way of learning new topics for most people, whether it’s by reading a book, watching a video, or listening to a podcast. The problem is that it doesn’t result in the best understanding of the topic and the learner cannot memorize key information.
            Better results can be achieved through “Interactive learning” where learners have opportunities to practice the knowledge with quizzes or flashcards, see their progress and areas of improvement, and customize and research for further content. But this approach is a real hard work. 
            </p>
            <p>In an extensive research involving 300 million students around the world, Professor John Hattie of the University of Melbourne has <a href="https://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/" class="inline-link" target="_blank">evaluated 252 variables</a> and their effect sizes related to student achievement. Hattie was curious about which variables would have the biggest impact. ”Although almost everything we do improves learning, why not prioritize the ones that will have the greatest effect?” Hattie calculated a score or effect size for each according to its impact on the students’ learning and took into account any aspects that could be taken into account as regards implementation costs. In this list, around half of the variables have Potential to accelerate or considerably accelerate student achievement. We have been focusing on some of these variables in our project, which we combined with user interviews result to come up with the application’s features.</p>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <div class="interview">
            <h3>User Interview</h3>
            <p>To gather qualitative data about the users, we conducted a user interview process. Our main objective was to identify our user persona, their pain points, goals, and stories. We began with a pre-assumption of the user’s demography and categorized the users into three main learner types: high-school students, college or university students, and professionals who are studying for a career shift or promotions. We designed the interview questions to gain a deep understanding of our users’ needs, frustrations, and goals in the following areas:</p>
            <ul class="list-style">
                <li>What are their frustrations when studying topics that require reading and memorizing?</li>
                <li>What method of studying works best for them?</li>
                <li>How do they keep engaged in learning a specific topic without getting bored and quitting?</li>
                <li>How do they ensure that they are competent after studying a topic?</li>
                <li>How do they prepare for an upcoming exam?</li>
                <li>What assistive methods do they use to learn more efficiently?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We conducted and recorded nine user interviews and analyzed the answers using the thematic method in which we reviewed the answers, summarized key points, categorized and clustered them to define themes. This helped us to identify the key pain points and goals of our users and led to defining user persona and main features that meet the needs of our users and address their pain points.</p>

                <li>Frequency of taking quizzes or practice questions when preparing for exams</li>
                <li>The optimal number of questions in a preparing exam in the learning apps</li>
                <li>Relationship between the difficulty of the exam material and the number of questions in a quiz</li>
                <li>Types of regular academic tests(MCQ, Written, True/False, Other)</li>
                <li>Relationship between taking quizzes/practice sessions and competency</li>

        <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <p class="two-column">The user flow consists of four flows. The first flow allows user to import material and set a due date for that material. In this flow, we also considered proffessionals and casual users who don't want to use the study planner. The second flow, study, is dedicated to the methods that learners can interact with the leraning content. It also provides a dynamic study planner which is responsive to the changes in due dates and content volume. The progress flow shows the learning progress, both topic-based and time-based. And the last flow is daily challeng which helps users recall the past learning materials.</p>
