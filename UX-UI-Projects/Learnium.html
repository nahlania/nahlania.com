                <p>In today’s fast-paced world, the demand for efficient and effective learning solutions is higher than ever before. However, “Passive learning” is still the dominant way of learning new topics for most people, whether it’s by reading a book, watching a video, or listening to a podcast. The problem is that it doesn’t result in the best understanding of the topic and the learner cannot memorize key information.
                Better results can be achieved through “Interactive learning” where learners have opportunities to practice the knowledge with quizzes or flashcards, see their progress and areas of improvement, and customize and research for further content. But this approach is a real hard work.
                </p>
                <p>In an extensive research involving 300 million students around the world, Professor John Hattie of the University of Melbourne has <a href="https://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/" class="inline-link" target="_blank">evaluated 252 variables</a> and their effect sizes related to student achievement. Hattie was curious about which variables would have the biggest impact. ”Although almost everything we do improves learning, why not prioritize the ones that will have the greatest effect?” Hattie calculated a score or effect size for each according to its impact on the students’ learning and took into account any aspects that could be taken into account as regards implementation costs. In this list, around half of the variables have Potential to accelerate or considerably accelerate student achievement. We have been focusing on some of these variables in our project, which we combined with user interviews result to come up with the application’s features.</p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <div class="interview">
                <h3>User Interview</h3>
                <p>To gather qualitative data about the users, we conducted a user interview process. Our main objective was to identify our user persona, their pain points, goals, and stories. We began with a pre-assumption of the user’s demography and categorized the users into three main learner types: high-school students, college or university students, and professionals who are studying for a career shift or promotions. We designed the interview questions to gain a deep understanding of our users’ needs, frustrations, and goals in the following areas:</p>
                <ul class="list-style space-after">
                    <li>What are their frustrations when studying topics that require reading and memorizing?</li>
                    <li>What method of studying works best for them?</li>
                    <li>How do they keep engaged in learning a specific topic without getting bored and quitting?</li>
                    <li>How do they ensure that they are competent after studying a topic?</li>
                    <li>How do they prepare for an upcoming exam?</li>
                    <li>What assistive methods do they use to learn more efficiently?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Interpret & Analysis</h3>
                <p>We conducted and recorded nine user interviews and analyzed the answers using the thematic method in which we reviewed the answers, summarized key points, categorized and clustered them to define themes. This helped us to identify the key pain points and goals of our users and led to defining user persona and main features that meet the needs of our users and address their pain points.</p>

            <h2>Defining Principles</h2>
            <p>To form a shared understanding among the team, we discussed the principles of the application and how it organizes the imported data, creates a study plan, and gives feedback on the progress. FInally, we came up with the following terminology:</p>
            <ul class="list-style">
                <li>Course: the whole learning material which is created from an imported content. It includes several key topics</li>
                <li>Key Topic/Topic: The identified titles/headings in the course. This is the basic learning unit based on which flash cards, summary and quizzes are created</li>
                <li>Quiz: The exam for each key topic</li>
                <li>Comprehensive Test/Test: The exam from course</li>
                <li>Completed Topic: When a user takes at least three quizzes for a topic and score more than 80% (B+) in average, the key topic is considered completed</li>
                <li>Completed Course: When all key topics in a course are completed, or the user has taken at least three comprehensive tests with an average score of 80% or more, the course is considered completed</li>
                <li>Active Course: Some or all of key topics are not completed yet</li>

        <section id="user-flow" class="max-width">
            <h2>User Flow</h2>
            <p class="two-column">The user flow consists of four flows. The first flow allows user to import material and set a due date for that material. In this flow, we also considered proffessionals and casual users who don't want to use the study planner. The second flow, study, is dedicated to the methods that learners can interact with the leraning content. It also provides a dynamic study planner which is responsive to the changes in due dates and content volume. The progress flow shows the learning progress, both topic-based and time-based. And the last flow is daily challeng which helps users recall the past learning materials.</p>

            <h2>Wireframe</h2>
            <div >
                <p>After confirming the user flow in the team meetings, we created the wireframe through multiple iterations. In some sections, we noticed that the wireframe needed to be changed for a better user experience. These changes led to changes in user flow, as well. In the final version, we added annotations for the developers to prevent confusion and maximize efficiency.</p><p>Based on the user flow and modified features, the wireframes are categorized as follows:</p>

            <div class="wireframe1">
                <h3>Study Flow Iterations</h3>
                <p>This is the first page that the user views, after logging into the application. For a learner who's been using the app for a while and imported content, the learning schedule is shown as Today's Plan. It consists of three sections:</p>
                <ul class="list-style">
                    <li>New content that is planned to be learned today</li>
                    <li>Missed content from previous days which is content that the user hasn't started yet</li>
                    <li>Review includes content that the user hasn't got an average of 80% or more in the taken quizzes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the first iteration, we wanted the user to be able to see all the content categories at a glance. That's the reason we incorporated Next Days’ Plan, Recent Materials, All Folders, and Create New Learning Material on the same page as Today's Plan, as follows:</p>
                <div class="grid">
                    <img class="col-m-4" src="../Assets/Images/Learnium/Wireframe-Study1-v1.webp" alt="wireframe">

                </div>
                <p>In the user testing, we noticed that this design confused the users and they couldn't find the main intended actions on the page. Therefore, in the second iteration, we removed all unnecessary sections from the home page to help the user focus on the most important action on the page which is starting the Study.</p>
                <div class="grid">
                    <img class="col-m-4" src="../Assets/Images/Learnium/Wireframe-Study1-v2.webp" alt="wireframe">

                        <ol class="ordered-list-style-2-digits two-column">
                            <li>The character and greeting message</li>
                            <li>Turns on and off the focus mode</li>
                            <li>Missed content includes the key topics which are not completed at scheduled time. The user sees this part of carousel when there is at least one missed content</li>
                            <li>Today’s content includes key topics that are planned for today. If missed content is empty, the user sees this part of carousel when opening the app</li>
                            <li>Review content include the key topics that user has already taken quizzes for, but the average score is below 80% and it means the key topic isn’t completed yet and needs to be reviewed. If there’s no missed content and today’s content, the user sees this part of carousel when opens the app</li>
                            <li>Open page 6 to view all future and completed key topics</li>
                            <li>Takes the user to the “upload content” page</li>
                        </ol>
                    </details>
                </div>
                <p>In the final iteration of the high-fidelity mockup, we transformed the carousel into tabs to free up more space for the text. This was an essential improvement since the app is text-heavy, and we needed to utilize the space efficiently. Moreover, we removed the Study Plan section from the home screen to keep it focused on what learners need to do NOW. Along with this change, we modified the UI design in a few iterations to segregate the tabs. The last result is as follows:</p>
                <div class="grid">
                    <img class="col-m-4" src="../Assets/Images/Learnium/Wireframe-Study1-v3.webp" alt="wireframe">

            </div>
            <div class="wireframe2">
                <h3>Flashcards Iterations</h3>
                <p>We reviewed some famous flashcard applications to understand the users' mental models. To ensure serving users with different learning preferences, we decided to design two types of flashcards:</p>

                </ol>
                <p>In the first iteration, we provided an input field on the second-type flashcard enabling the users to type down the phrase, if it helps them memorize. With a toggle below the flashcards, users could decide which type of card they prefer to see. Also, a written guide was designed to help navigate through the cards. The first iteration was designed as below:</p>
                <div class="grid">
                    <img class="col-m-6 col-ml-3" src="../Assets/Images/Learnium/Wireframe-Flashcard1-v1.webp" alt="wireframe">
                    <img class="col-m-6 col-ml-3" src="../Assets/Images/Learnium/Wireframe-Flashcard2-v1.webp" alt="wireframe">
                    <img class="col-m-6 col-ml-3" src="../Assets/Images/Learnium/Wireframe-Flashcard3-v1.webp" alt="wireframe">
                    <img class="col-m-6 col-ml-3" src="../Assets/Images/Learnium/Wireframe-Flashcard4-v1.webp" alt="wireframe">
                </div>
                <p>In the second iteration, we added a page to set up the flashcards type, before starting the learning session. This helps learners keep concentrated on learning, without being distracted by the flashcard type toggle. The setup page also enables users to turn on focus mode which mutes the phone's notification for a while:</p>
                <div class="grid">
                    <div class="col-m-4"></div>
                    <img class="col-m-4" src="../Assets/Images/Learnium/Wireframe-Flashcard0-v2.webp" alt="wireframe">
                    <div class="col-m-4"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Also, to make the screen less distracting, we moved the Add and Edit icons to a menu on top of the cards. On the other hand, in the first iteration, the typing was possible only on the second-type flashcard. We assumed that users might be reluctant to type long texts as descriptions. However, the user testing showed that for some learners, this is a helpful feature and they can utilize it with the help of the speech-to-text feature on most phones.</p>

                <p>After experimenting with a few more designs for the flashcards and testing their usability with real users and other stakeholders, we finally came up with a simple design in the high-fidelity wireframe. In user testing, we observed that users with different mental modes navigate through the card in different ways. For some users swiping right meant next and for others, it meant back. Based on these observations, we decided to design a guide to avoid confusion for users with different digital habits. Also, the first side and second side of the cards are differentiated with color for a better user experience. The final result for the guide and the second-type card is as follows:</p>

                    There's no perfect solution for a design challenge because users may have different mental models. Each solution has its advocates and critics. However, the key lies in the process of iterations and testing. We faced this challenge in the design of the flashcards, when different users had differnt expectaions while testing the app. The final design is a result of this ongoing process, shaped by feedback and user testing, ensuring that it not only meets the needs of the audience but also stands up to the diverse perspectives it might encounter.</span></li>
