            <div class="two-column">
                <p>Over 97,000 restaurants with $85 million annual sales in Canada prove that this is an attractive market, however, 8 out of 10 new restaurants fail within 5 years. These businesses often struggle to utilize marketing tools due to their complexity and cost. We interviewed a focus group to have a better understanding of the needs of food hospitality businesses. Integrating these interview reports with firsthand knowledge of the challenges faced by family-owned restaurants, we summarized the main pain points in the marketing section to be addressed:</p>
                <ul class="list-style">
                    <li>Marketing is a serious challenge for these businesses, and they need to stand out in a competitive market.</li>
                    <li>During high seasons, although the number of customers sees a peak, it’s not always beneficial for the businesses, since they don’t have any control over the menu items which are mostly ordered.</li>
                    <li> During low seasons, they need to utilize marketing tools to attract new customers. These tools include Facebook ads, subscription-based platforms, and generic review platforms. However, business managers are unable to measure the accurate success of each tool.</li>
                    <li> Another approach for increasing visibility is influencer marketing. In this case, business managers who are busy enough with the workflow must dedicate time to exploring relevant influencers’ pages, dealing and negotiating with them, and finally commissioning an advertisement. This is a challenge for food hospitalities, especially small businesses with limited time and capital. Moreover, in this approach, the actual KPIs are not trackable.</li>
                    <li>Word-of-mouth is another existing alternative. Although it is a powerful marketing tactic, it is barely considered a marketing tool, because it’s not trackable.</li>

                            Small restaurants struggle to gain visibility and attract sale due to limited marketing budgets. While affiliate marketing presents an effective solution, the complexity of creating and managing campaigns poses challenges. Customer relationship management(CRM) also needs a huge investment.

Some restaurant may use affiliate networks like ShareASale, collaboration with social media influencers, implementation of in-house referral programs, hiring digital marketing agencies, and do-it-yourself marketing efforts through social media and SEO which are time-consuming and costly

                        <p>Dealicious goes beyond acquiring new customers. The platform incorporates a robust loyalty program that allows business owners to reward and incentivize existing customers. Happy customers who register on the platform become Super Customers and share their culinary experiences with others. When a referral successfully works, the super customers collect points which can be redeemed to get discounts.
                        This helps food businesses foster loyalty and encourage repeat visits for Super Customers. It empowers food hospitalities to build lasting relationships with their customers, creating a loyal customer base that becomes a reliable source of revenue and positive word-of-mouth referrals.

            <p class="two-column">The user flow consists of three sections, the main section targets the main persona who is the business owner. They can create campaigns, invite customers to become super customers, burn the discount codes, and more importantly, check the insights for all active and past campaigns. The second part is the flow that loyal customers go through to refer new customers and use their discounts or points. The last part of the flow is the new customer's journey to check the referred restaurant's campaigns, activate one of them, and become a super customer if they want.</p>

                        <p>The primary color represents the restaurant industry, with orange conveying energy and creativity, aligning with dining experiences’ lively nature. It evokes warmth and appetizing appeal, perfect for a food-related app.The secondary color symbolizes profit and the word “Deal,” using green to signify growth and prosperity. It also connects to organic and healthy elements, relatable to the food industry. As a data visualization platform, we use variations of the primary and secondary colors to effectively represent and differentiate data points.</p>
                        <p>For typography, we chose Ubuntu Bold from Google Fonts for headings. Ubuntu’s rounded and modern appearance adds an elegant touch, contributing to a contemporary and friendly aesthetic. For body text, we opted for Mukta Light, also from Google Fonts, ensuring clarity and legibility.</p>
