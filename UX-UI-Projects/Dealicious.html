            <div class="two-column">
                <p>Over 97,000 restaurants with $85 million annual sales in Canada prove that this is an attractive market, however, 8 out of 10 new restaurants fail within 5 years. These businesses often struggle to utilize marketing tools due to their complexity and cost. We interviewed a focus group to have a better understanding of the needs of food hospitality businesses. Integrating these interview reports with firsthand knowledge of the challenges faced by family-owned restaurants, we summarized the main pain points in the marketing section to be addressed:</p>
                <ul class="list-style">
                    <li>Marketing is a serious challenge for these businesses, and they need to stand out in a competitive market.</li>
                    <li>During high seasons, although the number of customers sees a peak, it’s not always beneficial for the businesses, since they don’t have any control over the menu items which are mostly ordered.</li>
                    <li> During low seasons, they need to utilize marketing tools to attract new customers. These tools include Facebook ads, subscription-based platforms, and generic review platforms. However, business managers are unable to measure the accurate success of each tool.</li>
                    <li> Another approach for increasing visibility is influencer marketing. In this case, business managers who are busy enough with the workflow must dedicate time to exploring relevant influencers’ pages, dealing and negotiating with them, and finally commissioning an advertisement. This is a challenge for food hospitalities, especially small businesses with limited time and capital. Moreover, in this approach, the actual KPIs are not trackable.</li>
                    <li>Word-of-mouth is another existing alternative. Although it is a powerful marketing tactic, it is barely considered a marketing tool, because it’s not trackable.</li>

                        <p>Dealicious goes beyond acquiring new customers. The platform incorporates a robust loyalty program that allows business owners to reward and incentivize existing customers. Happy customers who register on the platform become Super Customers and share their culinary experiences with others. When a referral successfully works, the super customers collect points which can be redeemed to get discounts.
                        This helps food businesses foster loyalty and encourage repeat visits for Super Customers. It empowers food hospitalities to build lasting relationships with their customers, creating a loyal customer base that becomes a reliable source of revenue and positive word-of-mouth referrals.

            <h2>User Flow</h2>
            <p class="two-column">The user flow consists of three sections, the main section targets the main persona who is the business owner. They can create campaigns, invite customers to become super customers, burn the discount codes, and more importantly, check the insights for all active and past campaigns. The second part is the flow that loyal customers go through to refer new customers and use their discounts or points. The last part of the flow is the new customer's journey to check the referred restaurant's campaigns, activate one of them, and become a super customer if they want.</p>

            <div>
                <p>After confirming the user flow in the team meetings, we created the wireframe through multiple iterations. In some sections, we noticed that the user flow needed to be changed for a better user experience. These changes led to changes in user flow, as well. In the final version, we added annotations for the developers to prevent confusion and maximize efficiency.</p><p>To create a seamless user experience, we created the mobile view and desktop view screens at the same time. Considering the personas and use cases, the focus for the business owner was on the desktop version, while for the customers we went for a mobile-first design.</p><br><p>Based on the user flow and modified features, the wireframes are categorized as follows:</p>
                <ul class="list-style">

                <h3>Campaigns Flow Iterations</h3>
                <p>Campaigns is designed as the home screen of the Restaurant Owner Dashboard. The functionality of this page is to enable users to keep track of their marketing campaigns. It was primarily divided into three sections: Ongoing, Upcoming, and Past Campaigns. However, in the later iterations, we transferred Past Campaigns into Insights to keep the home page focused on what is going on from now on to help the business owner make marketing decisions, accordingly.</p>
                <p>In the first iteration, we designed cards for each campaign to segregate them. Also, we wanted to illustrate charts for different data that is driven from the campaign, as well as the basic information of the campaign including name, date, etc.</p>
                <div class="grid align-items-center">
                    <div class="framed desktop col-m-9">
                        <div class="v-scrollable">
                            <img src="../Assets/Images/Dealicious/Wireframe-Campaign1-v1d.webp" alt="wireframe">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Since we wanted to visualize numerous data, this approach of dividing cards' info into tabs wasn't scaleable, especially on mobile phones where we needed to consider a fat-finger-friendly design. Therefore, in the second iteration, we changed tabs into a dropdown menu. Also, to create a simpler and cleaner home page, we designed expandable cards, which show the charts only in the expanded mode. With the featured campaign and comparative chart on top, we made sure that users can view the most important data at first glance and without extra clicks.</p>

                <p>The primary color represents the restaurant industry, with orange conveying energy and creativity, aligning with dining experiences’ lively nature. It evokes warmth and appetizing appeal, perfect for a food-related app. The secondary color symbolizes profit and the word “Deal,” using green to signify growth and prosperity. It also connects to organic and healthy elements, relatable to the food industry. As a data visualization platform, we use variations of the primary and secondary colors to effectively represent and differentiate data points.</p>
                <p>For typography, we chose Ubuntu Bold from Google Fonts for headings. Ubuntu’s rounded and modern appearance adds an elegant touch, contributing to a contemporary and friendly aesthetic. For body text, we opted for Mukta Light, also from Google Fonts, ensuring clarity and legibility.</p>

While advocating my well-thought design decisions, eventually, in some not-critical cases, I had to compromise my ideals to achieve a solid functional solution, due to technical and time constraints. This required a deeper understanding of the persona and coming to realize which features are negligible and which ones are crucial in terms of user experience.</span></li>

With this MVP, data is only retrieved from user input and is only related to the campaigns that are run through the app. In this way, insight can be affected by human errors. To provide a more accurate data visualization and also to create a better experience for the users, we could integrate Dealicious into the current POS systems in the restaurants. Adding this extra feature not only could have taken a couple of weeks to design and develop but also we needed real users who agreed with this integration.</span></li>
